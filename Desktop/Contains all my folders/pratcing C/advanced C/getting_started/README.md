Welcome to my world of C programming
This directory is going to be all about geting started with advanced programming using C language,
am making this repo dir so as to keep track of all my progress and keep track.

In this directory, i will be uploading files relating to C data structures, arrays,
pointers and so on.
This directory is only going to be on my codes relating to C data types,
both primitive and user defined.

1. i wrote a program using the getchar() and putchar() functions rather than using the newly fashioned printf() and scanf() or fgets()

2. A program that scans for the characters A, E & F in a persons name and return found if found "scanchar.c"
